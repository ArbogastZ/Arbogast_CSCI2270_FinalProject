## Summary ##

My final project consists of a searchable dictionary As Well As User Defined thesaurus. Every time the Program Launches it reads in and stores the user defined thesaurus and dictionary which should be saved in the same file location as the project folder. The User will have a menu with a "Word Of The Day." The Dictionary Functionalities include "print section" and "search." If you do not know the correct spelling of a word, type in as much as you **know** is correct EG. "mou" for mountain. The Thesaurus is user defined but not user proof, please follow input instructions carefully. The user can add to their thesaurus as well as eliminate connections to words from it. The user can also print all the words in their thesaurus, or just print the connections to one word. The 2nd functionality in the main menu entitled "How Accurate Is My Paper" is not completed.

## How To Run ##

## Open Issues/Bugs ##
Its Not A Bug, Its A "Feature"; all kidding aside however, the 2nd option on the main menu does not have any functionality tied to it, and deleting an entire entry will crash the program. Also, Many times if user input is not formatted properly the program will crash EG. "Please enter two words separated by commas and a number" should mean "hi,man,30" not "hi , man ," and if the latter is used the program will crash
